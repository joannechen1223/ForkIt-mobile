# ForkIt Mobile

Hi we are the founders of ForkIt üç¥
an app that takes the frustration out of dining by making menus more intuitive.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Demo Video

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app
   The app should is developed by React Native framework, which suppose to be cross-platform. Yet, we only tested on iOS device in the current stage. You
   can install [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) while
   setting up your dev environment.

   ```bash
    # build on iOS simulator
    npm run ios
    # build on your dev device
    npm run ios:device
   ```

   [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) is not working as we set up the Firebase Auth which is not compatible with Expo Go.
